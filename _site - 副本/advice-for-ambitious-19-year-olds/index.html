</blockquote>

<p>“I’m an ambitious 19 year old, what should I do?”</p>

<p>I get asked this question fairly often, and I now have a lot of data on what works, so I thought I’d share my response.</p>

<p>Usually, people are deciding between going to college (and usually working on side projects while they do so), joining a company, or starting their own startup. <code>[1]</code> <code>[2]</code></p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: choice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>go to college</li>
  <li>join a company</li>
  <li>start own startup</li>
</ul>

<p>The secret is that any of these can be right answer, and you should make your decision based on the specific circumstances of each option. The critical point is that you want to do the thing that is most likely to get you on a path to do something great.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: several points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choice没有对错、优劣；</li>
  <li>choose the thing you want，更有可能变为great；</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>思考</strong>：想做的事情很多，并且不知道到底真正想做什么怎么办？那就不断尝试，直到找到真正想做的事情？尝试的过程中，半途而废怎么办？</p>

<p>No matter what you choose, build stuff and be around smart people. “Stuff” can be a lot of different things—open source projects outside of class, a startup, a new sales process at a company you work at—but, obviously, sitting around talking with your friends about how you guys really should build a website together does not count.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>:选择之后，两件事：</p>

<ul>
  <li>build stuff（行动起来，而不是空谈）</li>
  <li>be around smart people</li>
</ul>

<p>The best people always seem to be building stuff and hanging around smart people, so if you have to decide between several options, this may be a good filter.</p>

<p>Working on something good will pull you along a path where good things keep happening to you. (In fact, this effect is so strong that there’s a danger of getting sucked into too many interesting things and getting distracted from what you really want to do.)</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: hang around smart people，有几点客观情况：</p>

<ul>
  <li>你有多个options时，smart people会影响你做出正确的决定；</li>
  <li>专注正确的事，正确的事情就会不断到来；</li>
  <li>与smart people在一起，风险：太多interesting things，迷乱自己，可能迷失自己最想做的事；</li>
</ul>

<p>In making this decision, you want to take the right kind of risk. Most people think about risk the wrong way—for example, staying in college seems like a non-risky path. However, getting nothing done for four of your most productive years is actually pretty risky. Starting a company that you’re in love with is the right kind of risk. Becoming employee number 50 at a company that still has a good chance of failure is the wrong kind of risk.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: 做决定时，要承担相应的risk；有人对risk的看法是错误的，要认真看待risk，特别是有的时候看似无risk，其实risk很大，空耗时间也是风险。</p>

<p>If you stay in college, make sure you learn something worthwhile and work on interesting projects—college is probably the best place to meet people to work with. If you’re really worried you’ll miss some critical social experience by dropping out of college, you should probably stay.</p>

<p>疑问：miss some critical social experience，什么含义？</p>

<p>If you join a company, my general advice is to join a company on a breakout trajectory. There are a usually a handful of these at a time, and they are usually identifiable to a smart young person. They are a very good risk/reward tradeoff. Such a company is almost certainly going to be successful, but the rest of the world isn’t quite as convinced of it as they should be. Fortunately, these companies love ambitious young people. In addition to the equity being a great deal (you might get 1/10th of the equity you’d get if you going a tiny new startup, but at 1/100th or 1/1000th of the risk), you will work with very good people, learn what success looks like, and get a W on your record (which turns out to be quite valuable). Spending a few years at a company that fails has path consequences, and working at an already-massively-successful company means you will learn much less, and probably work with less impressive people.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: 选择company，几点：</p>

<ul>
  <li>处在爆发增长的company（行业、公司）
    <ul>
      <li>一段时期，数量很少；</li>
      <li>能识别出 smart young </li>
      <li>these companies love ambitious young</li>
      <li>good risk/reward tradeoff</li>
      <li>相对new startup，以1/100th ~ 1/1000th 的 risk，换取 1/10th 的 quity</li>
      <li>company注定successful，但其他人不相信会这样</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>这样的company，有几点：
    <ul>
      <li>work with smart people</li>
      <li>learn what success looks like</li>
      <li>get a W on your record(quite valuable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>其他company与上面情况相反</li>
</ul>

<p>Incidentally, don’t let salary be a factor. I just watched someone turn down one of these breakout companies because Microsoft offered him $30k per year more in salary—that was a terrible decision. He will not build interesting things and may not work with smart people. In a few years, when it’s time for something new, the options in front of him will be much worse than they could have been.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: 不要过多考虑 salary，认准 breakout company，情况会发生改变。</p>

<p>If you start a company, only do so if you have an idea you’re in love with. If you’re hanging out with your friends trying to come up with an idea, I don’t think you should start that company (although there are many who disagree with me). Starting a failed startup is less bad than joining a failed company as an employee (and you’ll certainly learn much more in the former case). If you fail at an idea that you really loved and could have been great, you’re unlikely to regret it, and people will not hold it against you. Failing at a me-too copycat startup is worse. Remember that there will be lots of other opportunities to start companies, and that startups are a 6-10 year commitment—wait for the right one</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: start a company，几点：</p>

<ul>
  <li>only do what you love</li>
  <li>个人不建议为了尝试而start company（不过，很多人支持尝试start company）</li>
  <li>start a failed startup 好过 join a failed company as an employee</li>
  <li>fail at a me-too copycat startup is worse</li>
  <li>there will be lots of opportunities</li>
  <li>startups are a 6-10 year commitment</li>
  <li>wait for the right one</li>
</ul>

<p>One big pro for starting a company is that it’s usually the way to learn the most in the shortest amount of time. One big con is that it’s easy to start a company for the wrong reasons—usually so that you can say you’re starting a company—and this makes it easy to cloud your judgment.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: start a startup，有两个主流看法：</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pro: learn the most in the shortest amount of time.</li>
  <li>Con: start a company for the wrong reasons, cloud your judgment.</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter what you choose, keep your personal burn rate low and minimize your commitments. I have seen a lot of people miss great opportunities because they couldn’t afford a reduction in salary or because they couldn’t move or didn’t have the time.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: 无论做什么选择，有一点：</p>

<ul>
  <li>降低花费，降低做事情的成本</li>
  <li>谨慎承诺，为自己留充足时间</li>
</ul>

<p>降低下面的因素：</p>

<ul>
  <li>couldn’t move（reduction in salary）</li>
  <li>don’t have the time</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about risk the right way. Drew Houston gave a great commencement speech where he said you only have to be right once. That’s true. The risk is not getting on the path where you get to be right that one critical time.</p>

<p><strong>notes(ningg)</strong>: 几点：</p>

<ul>
  <li>正确看待risk</li>
  <li>真正的risk是：没有在做你应该做的事情 <em>（是这样吗？）</em></li>
</ul>

<p>1 Sometimes, a 4th option is being a VC. This is usually a mistake—the best way to become a VC is not to grind your way up the ladder from junior associate intern. Even if you want to be a VC, you’re much better off starting or joining a startup, and getting partner offers when you’re 28. Plus, good founders want to work with an investor that has operational experience.
1 Interestingly, no one is ever considering going into academia.</p>
