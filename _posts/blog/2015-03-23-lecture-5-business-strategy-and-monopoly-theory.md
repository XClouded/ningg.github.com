Today’s speaker is Peter Thiel, Peter was the founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders Fund and has invested in most of the tech companies in Silicon Valley. He's going to talk about strategy and competition.

今天主题：策略和竞争。


I sort of have a single idée fixe that I'm completely obsessed with on the business side which is that if you're starting a company, if you’re the founder, entrepreneur, starting a company you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to always avoid competition. And so hence competition is for losers, something we’ll be talking about today.

整理了一些固定的想法*（久经考验的观点，哈哈）*。对于一个企业家，希望的是垄断，而避免竞争；因此，只有失败者才会竞争*（竞争，说明战斗还没结束）*，今天我们就讨论这个问题。

I'd like to start by saying something about the basic idea of when you start one of these companies, how do you go about creating value? What makes a business valuable? And I want to suggest there's basically a very simple formula, that if you have a valuable company two things are true. Number one, that it creates "X" dollars of value for the world. Number two, that you capture "Y" percent of "X.” And the critical thing that I think people always miss in this sort of analysis is that "X" and "Y" are completely independent variables, and so "X" can be very big and "Y" can be very small. "X" can be an intermediate size and if "Y” is reasonably big, you can still have a very big business.

设立一个company时，准备如何创造价值？商业价值由什么构成？这是一个很简单的式子，一个有价值的company，有两点：

* 为现实世界，创造了 `X`$ 的价值；
* capture `Y` percent of `X`；

有个很重要的点，很多人都想错了，那就是：`X`、`Y`这两个变量是完全相互独立的，因此，`X`可能非常大，但`Y`却非常小；`X`只是一个中等的值，但`Y`却比较大，此时，也说明是一个非常好的商业模式。

So to create a valuable company you have to basically both create something of value and capture some fraction of the value of what you've created. And sort of just to illustrate this as a contrast, if you compare the US airline industry with a company like Google on search, if you measure by the size of these industries you could say that airlines are still more important than search, just measured by revenue. [For airline carriers] there’s $195 billion in domestic revenues in 2012; Google had just north of $50 billion. And certainly on some intuitive level if you were given a choice and said, well would you want to get rid of all air travel, or do you want to give up search engines, the intuition would be that air travel is something that's more important than search. And this is of course just the domestic numbers.

创立一个有价值的公司，要求你，既要为社会创造价值*（市场规模？营业额？）*，也要获取这些价值的合理比例*（利润率）*。

If you'd look at this globally, airlines are much much bigger than search, than Google is, but the profit margins are quite a bit less. They were marginally profitable in 2012, I think in the entire hundred year history of the airline industry, the cumulative profits in the US have been approximately zero. The companies make money, they episodically go bankrupt, they get recapitalized, and you sort of cycle and repeat. And this is reflected in the combined market capitalization of the airline industry, which may be something like a quarter of Google's. So you have search much smaller than air travel but much more valuable. I think this reflects these very different valuations on "X" and "Y."


If we look at perfect competition, there's some pros and cons to the world of perfect competition. On a high level, this is something you always study in Econ I, it's always easy to model, which is why I think econ professors like talking about perfect competition. It somehow is efficient, especially in a world where things are static, because you have all the consumer surplus that’s captured by everybody, and politically it’s what we’re told is good in our society: you want to have competition and it’s somehow a good thing. Of course there are a lot of negatives, it's generally not that good if you're involved in anything that’s hyper competitive, because you often don't make money. I’ll come back to this a little bit later. So I think on one end of the spectrum you have industries that are perfectly competitive and at the other end of the spectrum you have things that I would say are monopolies, and they’re much more stable longer term businesses, you have more capital, and if you get a creative monopoly for inventing something new, I think it's symptomatic of having created something really valuable.

看一下理想的竞争*（完美的竞争）*，既有支持者，也有反对者。教授告诉我们，充分竞争是好东西。当然，也有不好的一面，在一定时期内，由于做最好的产品无法盈利，因此出于竞争压力，被迫生产次优产品。最终的情况是，有些行业充分竞争，市场发挥作用；另外一些行业直接高效垄断，并且投资新事物，这也是垄断行业创造价值的方式。


I do think the extreme binary view of the world I always articulate is that there are exactly two kinds of businesses in this world, there are businesses that are perfectly competitive and there are businesses that are monopolies. There is shockingly little that is in between. And this dichotomy is not understood very well because people are constantly lying about the nature of the businesses they are in. And in my mind this is not necessarily the most important thing in business, but I think it's the most important business idea that people don't understand, that there are just these two kinds of businesses.

我认为世界上的商业是两级的，要么完全市场化，充分竞争，要么完全垄断经营；很少介于两者之间的商业模式。这种二分的模式，不被人们理解，因为从业者在说谎。

So let me tell you a little bit about the lies people tell. If you imagine that there was a spectrum of companies from perfect competition to monopoly, the apparent differences are quite small because the people who have monopolies pretend not to. They will basically say, and it’s because you don’t want to get regulated by the government, you don’t want the government to come after you, so you will never say that you have a monopoly. So anyone who has a monopoly will pretend that they are in incredible competition; and on the other end of the spectrum if you are incredibly competitive, and if you’re in some sort of business where you will never make any money, you'll be tempted to tell a lie that goes in the other direction, where you will say that you're doing something unique that is somehow less competitive than it looks because you'll want to differentiate, you will want to try and attract capital, or something like that. So if the monopolists pretend not to have monopolies, the non-monopolies pretend to have monopolies, the apparent difference is very small whereas the real difference I would submit is actually quite big. So there’s this business distortion that happens because of the lies people tell about their businesses and the lies are sort of in these opposite directions.

我将说一下，从业者在哪些地方撒了谎。垄断企业，为了防止政府的干预，撒谎说自己是有竞争的行业；充分竞争的企业，因为利润低下，撒谎说自己的目标是在走向弱竞争领域。

Let me drill a little bit down further on the way these lies work. And so the basic lie you tell as a non-monopoly is that we're in a very small market. The basic lie you tell as a monopoly is the market you’re in is much bigger than it looks. So typically if you want to think of this in set theoretic terms, you could say that a monopoly tells a lie where you describe your business as the union of these vastly different markets and the non-monopolist describes it as the intersection. So in effect, if you're a non-monopolist you will rhetorically describe your market as super small, you're the only person in that market. If you have a monopoly you'll describe it as super big and there's lots of competition in it.

从集合理论来看这个问题，如果一家公司在某个细分领域是垄断的，他把领域扩大，就变成不垄断了；如果一家公司是参与充分竞争的，他们领域缩小到某个细分领域，就成垄断的了，这么看来，随意极了。

Some examples of how this works in practice. I always use restaurants as the example of a terrible business, this is always sort of the idea that capital accumulation and competition are antonyms. If someone accumulates capital, a world of perfect competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away. So you're opening a restaurant business, no one wants to invest because you just lose money, so you have to tell some idiosyncratic narrative and you'll say something like. "Well we're the only British food restaurant in Palo Alto.” So its British, Palo Alto and of course that's too small a market because people may be able to drive all the way to Mountain View or even Menlo Park and there probably are no people who eat nothing but British food, at least no people who are still alive.

So that's sort of a fictitiously narrow market. There is sort of a Hollywood version of all of this, the way movies always get pitched, where it’s like a college football star, you know, joins an elite group of hackers to catch the shark that killed his friend. Now that's a movie that has not yet been made, but the question is, "Is that the right category or is the correct category, it's just another movie?" In which case there are lots of those, it’s super competitive, it’s incredibly hard to make money, no one ever makes money in Hollywood making movies, it’s really really hard.

上述，随意扩大、缩小市场领域划分，实际上是不合理的，只是借口而已。

So you always have this question about is the intersection real? Does it make sense? Does it have value? And of course there are startup versions of this, and in the really bad versions you just take a whole series of the buzzwords: sharing, mobile, social apps, you combine them and give some kind of narrative and whether or not that's a real business or not, it is generally a bad sign. It's almost this pattern recognition when you have this rhetoric of these sort of intersections, it generally does not work. The something of somewhere is really mostly just the nothing of nowhere, it's like the Stanford of North Dakota, one of a kind, but it's not Stanford.

创业公司，说自己是某个领域独一无二的*（目标：垄断）*。

Let's look at the opposite, the opposite lie, is if you are let's say the search company that’s down the street from here and has about a happy sixty-six percent market share and is completely dominant in the search market. Google almost never describes itself as a search engine these days and instead it describes itself in all these different ways. So it sometimes says it’s an advertising company. So if it was search you would say, well it's like it has this huge market share that's really crazy, so it's like an incredible monopoly, it's a much bigger and much more robust monopoly than Microsoft ever had in the nineties, maybe that's why it’s making so much money. But if you say it's an advertising market, you could say well, search advertising is seventeen billion and that's part of online advertising, which is much bigger and then, you know, all US advertising is bigger, and then by the time you get to global advertising, that's close to five hundred billion and so you're talking about three and a half percent, so a tiny part of this much larger market.

Google，扩大领域，不提自己是搜索引擎公司，而说自己是广告公司，以此说明自己不是垄断企业。

Or if you don't want to be an advertising company, you could always say you’re a technology company. The technology market is something like a one trillion dollar market and the narrative that you tell about Google and the technology market is, well we're competing with all the car companies with our self-driving cars, we’re competing with Apple on TVs and iPhones, we’re competing with Facebook, we’re competing with Microsoft on office products, we’re competing with Amazon on cloud services and so we're in this giant technology market, where there's competition in every direction you look and no we’re not the monopoly the government's looking for and we should not get regulated in any way whatsoever. So I think one has to always be super aware that there are these very powerful incentives to distort the nature of these markets, one way or the other.

The evidence of narrow markets in the tech industry is if you basically just, if you look at sort of the big tech companies, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they have just been building up cash for year after year and you have these incredibly high profit margins, and I would say that the that one of the reasons the tech industry in the US has been so successful financially is because it's prone to creating all these monopoly-like businesses and it's reflected by the fact that these companies just accumulate so much cash they don't even know what to do with it beyond a certain point.

这些人们熟知的科技公司都是在努力垄断市场，以此获取高额利润，他们积累的现金太多了，以至于不知道如何花。

Let me say a few things about how to build a monopoly, and I think one of the sort of very counterintuitive ideas that comes out of this monopoly thread is that you want to go after small markets. If you’re a startup, you want to get to monopoly. You’re starting a new company, you want to get to monopoly. Monopolies have a large share of the market, how do you get to a large share of the market? You start with a really small market and you take over the whole market and then over time you find ways to expand that market in concentric circles.

如何垄断市场呢？非常反直觉的做法：占领small market。垄断的核心就是，占领市场的绝大多数份额，如何才能做到？以small market切入，占领优势份额，然后独吞市场，再寻求扩张到周边市场*（同心圆方式，就是周边市场吧）*。

The thing that's always a big mistake is going after a giant market on day one because that's typically evidence that you somehow haven't defined categories correctly, that normally means there is going to be too much competition in one way or another, so I think almost all the successful companies in Silicon Valley had some model of starting with small markets and expanding. If you take Amazon, you start with just a bookstore, we have all the books in the world, it's a better bookstore than anybody else has in the world when it starts in the 1990s. It's online, there's things you can do that you could not do before, and then you gradually expand into all sorts of different forms of e-commerce and other things beyond that.

人们常犯的一个大错误：从大市场切入，这意味这激烈的竞争，一旦策略出错，就导致覆灭*（当前互联网领域，就是赢家通吃，不能垄断份额，就是覆灭一种结果，当然也可以寻求收购）*。我认为硅谷成功的公司，基本都是从小市场切入，然后扩张，这么一个策略。亚马逊开始只做图书，后来扩展为全品类*（以前自己看到徐新公开讲话，提到京东从电子产品，扩张开来，是出于市场规模的考虑，为公司设立更大的发展空间）*。

eBay, you start with Pez dispensers, you move on to Beanie Babies, and eventually it’s all these different online auctions for all these sorts of different goods. What’s very counterintuitive about many of these companies is they often start with markets that are so small, that people don't think they are valuable at all when you get started. The PayPal version of this was we started with power sellers on Ebay, which was about twenty thousand people. When we first saw this happening in December of 1999, January 2000 right after we launched, there was a sense that these were all, it was such a small market, it was terrible, we thought these were terrible customers to have, it's just people selling junk on the internet, why in the world we want to be going after this market?

eBay，从糖果起家，到芭比娃娃，再到全品类。有个违反直觉的地方是：这些很成功的公司都是以十分小的市场入手，以至于，大家都认为他们没有什么价值。*（不怕当前市场小，关键是要看到市场的发展，哪些市场是未来的趋势？哪些虽然大，但已被资本抛弃？关键还是，找准市场，切入。）*

But there was a way to get a product that was much better for everybody in that market, and we got to something like twenty five, thirty percent market penetration in two or three months, and you've got some walk in to brand recognition, and are able to build the business from there. So I always think these very small markets are quite underrated. The Facebook version of this I always give is that if the initial market at Facebook was ten thousand people at Harvard, it went from zero to sixty percent market share in ten days, that was a very auspicious start. The way this gets analyzed in business schools is always, that's so ridiculous, it's such a small market, it can't have any value at all. So I think the business school analysis of Facebook early on, or of Paypal early on, or of Ebay early on, is that the markets were perhaps so small as to have almost no value and that they would've had little value had they they stayed small, but it turned out there were ways to grow them concentrically and that's what made them so valuable.

市场规模虽小，但是却有一些产品能为市场中的人们提供便利，我们在2~3个月内，便占领了 25~30% 的市场份额。因此，我总是认为，小市场被严重低估了。人们公认的，这些小市场没有什么价值，但他们却快速成长，变得出乎意料的有价值。

Now I think the opposite version of this is always where you have super big markets and there is so many different things that went wrong with all the clean tech companies in the last decade. But the one theme than ran through almost all of them is that they all started with massive markets. Every clean tech powerpoint presentation that one saw in the years 2005 to 2008, which is the clean tech bubble in Silicon Valley, started with where the energy market, where the market was measured in hundreds and billions of trillions of dollars. And then once you're sort of like a minnow in a vast ocean, that is not a good place to be. That means you have tons of competitors and you don’t even know who all the competitors are.

切入大市场，通常意味着，没能精准定位客户、细分客户，也意味着，连竞争对手都看不全，风险很大。

You want to be a one of a kind company. You want to be the only player in a small ecosystem. You don’t want to be the fourth online pet food company. You don’t want to be the tenth solar panel company. You don’t want to be the hundredth restaurant in Palo Alto. Your restaurant industry is a trillion dollar industry. So if you do a market size analysis, you conclude restaurants are fantastic business to go into. And often large existing markets typically means that you have tons of competitions so it's very very hard to differentiate. The first very counterintuitive idea is to go after small markets, markets that are so small people often don't even think that they make sense. That's where you get a foothold and then if those markets are able expand, you can scale into a big monopoly business.

成为某个小生态圈中的霸主，不要称为某个在线宠物食物类网站的第四份额占有者，也不要力争去做太阳能面板领域的10家公司。

There are several different characteristics of these monopoly businesses that I'd like to focus on. There is no single formula. In technology there is always a sense that in the history of technology, every moment happens only once. The next Mark Zuckerberg won’t build a social network and the next Larry Page won’t be building a search engine, and the next Bill Gates won’t be building an operating system. If you are copying these people, you are not learning from them.

那些垄断的商业模式，有一些不同的特点，当然，没有通用的公式。

* 在科技领域，相同机会只出现一次，不会有第二次，例如，操作系统、收缩引擎、社交网络等；
* 有不少特别的商业模式，他们还没被人关注，反倒有潜力诞生垄断商业；
* 垄断商业一个特征：特有技术、方式，形成门槛；*（例如，亚马逊，渠道优势，通过走量，提升整体盈利；Paypal，提出便捷转账）*

There are always very unique businesses that are doing something that has not been done before and end up having the potential to be a monopoly. The opening line in Anna Karenina, that all happy families are alike and all unhappy families are unhappy in their own special way, is not true in business, where I think all happy companies are different because they're doing something very unique. All unhappy companies are alike because they failed to escape the essential sameness in competition.

One characteristic of a monopoly technology company is some sort of proprietary technology. My sort of crazy, somewhat arbitrary rule of thumb is you want to have a technology that's an order of magnitude better than the next best thing. So Amazon had over ten times as many books, it may not have been that high tech, but you figure oh well it can sell ten times as many books and be more efficient along the way. In the case of PayPal, Bill Turner was using checks to send money on Ebay, it took seven to ten days to clear, and PayPal could do it more than ten times as fast. You want to have some sort of very powerful improvement, some order of magnitude improvement, on some key dimension. Of course, if you just come with something totally new, it's just like an infinite improvement. I would say the iPhone was the first smart phone that worked, it may not be in fact, but it's so definitely an order of magnitude of an improvement. So I think the technology needs to be designed to give you a massive delta over the next the next best thing.


I think there often are network effects that can kick in and that really help the thing and these are linked to monopolies over time, the thing that is very tricky about network effects is they're often very hard to get started and so you know everyone understands how valuable they are. There's always this incredibly tricky question: why is it valuable to the first person who's doing something. Economies of scale, if you have something with very high fixed costs and very low marginal costs, that's typically a monopoly-like business.

网络技术，干预之后，会促使垄断商业的出现。关于网络技术，有个棘手的问题：网络技术非常难以切入，很难让所有人都理解他们的价值所在。常见的是这个问题：第一个人用心的方式做事情的时候，为什么这种新方式是有价值的？一个经济规模*（市场规模？）*，他有很高的固定成本，以及非常低的边际成本时，他很有可能发展称为垄断商业。*（边际成本，获得单位收益，所需要增加的投入，构成边际成本）*
